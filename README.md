This project has spawned out of the interest in learning a new framework. I have worked with [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org/) for a number of years and was interested to find that some of my colleagues are big Symfony2 fans.  

How hard can it be right?  

Well, a little more than I'd thought previously actually. So this is the second iteration of the project having tried to build an app on my existing database and run into trouble and too much massage of Symfony.  

Thus, here we are, with a proper domain model and new entities and matching database.
